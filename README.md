# Discord Suggestion Bot

A Discord bot (Node.js + discord.js v14) for collecting, displaying, and managing community suggestions. Users submit ideas via modals; suggestions are posted as embeds with voting. Admins can manage statuses and notes.

## Known Issues
When Submitting a form or running a command you may get timeout errors, re-trying fixes it, still troubleshooting

## Features
- **Dropdown panel (no typing needed)**: Admins can post a panel with a dropdown; users select Game or Community to open the form instantly. The panel is automatically refreshed to stay at the bottom after each new suggestion, so users always see it without pinning.
- **Slash commands**: `/suggest create` and `/suggest manage` for creation and admin management.
- **Dynamic modals**: Fields adapt based on suggestion type.
- **Embeds + reactions**: Suggestions are posted with üëç/üëé reactions; votes and percentages update in real time.
- **Voting lock on status**: When status is set (not clear), reactions are removed and voting is disabled.
- **Configurable locale/timezone**: `LOCALE` and `TIMEZONE` control all displayed dates/times.
- **Custom emojis**: Optional custom up/down emojis by name via guild config.
- **SQLite storage**: Persistent local DB (simple, no external server).
- **Docker support**: Build and run easily in containers.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ (tested with v20).
- A Discord Application + Bot with token and required intents.
- Bot permissions in your server: **Send Messages**, **Embed Links**, **Add Reactions**, **Read Message History**.

## Create and Invite Your Discord Bot
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an Application.
2. Add a Bot (Bot tab), then copy the bot token for your `.env` as `DISCORD_TOKEN`.
3. Under Bot settings, enable Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - Presence Intent: optional
   - Server Members Intent: optional
   - Message Content Intent: optional
   - Required intents for this bot: Guilds, Guild Messages, Guild Message Reactions (enabled by default at the Application level)
4. Invite the bot to your server using an OAuth2 URL with scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`.
   - Example template (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`):
     - [Invite the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=274877975616)
     - The `permissions` value grants Send Messages, Embed Links, Add Reactions, and Read Message History.

## Linux Setup (local)
1. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drunkmunki/suggester.git
   cd suggester
   npm install
   ```
2. Create `.env` in the project root:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   CHANNEL_ID=your_suggestion_channel_id
   ADMIN_ROLES=role_id1,role_id2
   DB_PATH=suggestions.db
   # Optional emoji customization (requires GUILD_ID)
   GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
   UPVOTE_EMOJI_NAME=upvote_emoji_name
   DOWNVOTE_EMOJI_NAME=downvote_emoji_name
   # Locale/Timezone config
   LOCALE=en-US
   TIMEZONE=UTC
   ```
3. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
4. (Optional) Run as a systemd service:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Suggester Bot
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/suggester
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/node index.js
   Restart=always

   EnvironmentFile=/path/to/suggester/.env

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   Then:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable suggester
   sudo systemctl start suggester
   ```

## Docker Setup

docker build -t suggestion-bot .
```

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name suggestion-bot \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token \
  -e CHANNEL_ID=your_suggestion_channel_id \
  -e ADMIN_ROLES=role_id1,role_id2 \

    volumes:
      - /host/path/to/db:/app
```

For Portainer, create a container from the image and set env vars/volumes via the UI.

## Configuration (.env)
- **DISCORD_TOKEN**: Required. Bot token from the Developer Portal.
- **CHANNEL_ID**: Required. Channel ID where suggestions are posted.
- **ADMIN_ROLES**: Optional. Comma-separated role IDs permitted to use admin commands (`/suggest manage`, `/suggest panel`).
- **DB_PATH**: Optional. Path to SQLite DB file. Defaults to `suggestions.db` in the working directory.
- **GUILD_ID**: Optional. Guild ID used to fetch custom emojis by name.
- **UPVOTE_EMOJI_NAME**: Optional. Custom upvote emoji name. Requires `GUILD_ID`.
- **DOWNVOTE_EMOJI_NAME**: Optional. Custom downvote emoji name. Requires `GUILD_ID`.
- **LOCALE**: Optional. Locale for date formatting (e.g., `en-GB`, `de-DE`). Default `en-US`.
- **TIMEZONE**: Optional. IANA timezone (e.g., `Europe/London`, `America/New_York`). Default `UTC`.

The bot auto-creates the SQLite table on startup.

## Commands and UI
- **/suggest panel** (admin-only):
  - Refreshes the panel in the current channel. If a previous panel exists, it is deleted and a fresh one is posted so it appears at the bottom.
  - Options in the panel:
    - **Game Suggestion**: Opens the Game modal.
    - **Community Suggestion**: Opens the Community modal.
  - The dropdown resets after selection so users can pick the same option again later.
  - The command replies ephemerally to confirm the refresh.

- **/suggest create type:<game|community>**:
  - Opens the corresponding modal via slash command.
  - Game modal fields: **Game Name**, **Map/Server Name**, **Suggestion**, **Reason**.
  - Community modal fields: **Suggestion Title**, **Suggestion in Detail**.

- **/suggest manage id:<number> status:<under consideration|implemented|not happening|clear> [notes:<text>]** (admin-only):
  - Sets the public status and optional notes for a suggestion.
  - When a non-`clear` status is set: voting reactions are removed and voting is disabled; the embed adds status and comment.
  - When `clear` is set: status/notes are removed and voting is re-enabled (reactions are restored if absent).
  - The success confirmation is ephemeral and auto-clears after ~5 seconds.
  - Admin notes are timestamped using your configured `LOCALE`/`TIMEZONE`.

### Voting behavior
- Users can vote with üëç or üëé (one active vote at a time; picking the other removes the first).
- The embed tracks counts and percentages; when a status is set (not clear), votes are frozen for that suggestion.

### Custom emojis
- If `GUILD_ID` and emoji names are provided, the bot will use those custom emojis for voting.

### Panel behavior
- The panel is kept at the bottom of the suggestions channel. After each successful suggestion submission, the bot deletes the previous panel (if any) and posts a fresh one so it remains visible.
- You can also run `/suggest panel` at any time to manually refresh/move the panel to the bottom.
- If no panel exists yet, running `/suggest panel` will create it; once created, it will be maintained automatically after submissions.

## Database
- SQLite database with tables:
  - `suggestions`: stores ID, user, type, details, status, notes, submission date, votes, and message ID.
  - `panel_state`: stores the current panel `message_id` per `channel_id` to enable automatic refresh at the bottom.
- To use another DB, adapt the queries in `index.js` accordingly.
